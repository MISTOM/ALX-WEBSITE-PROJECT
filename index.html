        <h4>What is ALX ?</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.alxafrica.com/" target="_blank">ALX Africa</a> is
          a leadership, employment, and entrepreneurship development
          organization. They select, develop, and connect Africa's brightest and
          most driven young talent. ALX helps us to source and seize meaningful
          work opportunities. It is the newest addition to the globally
          recognized

        <p>
          I stumbled upon
          <a href="https://www.alxafrica.com/" target="_blank">ALX</a> through
          an ad on a social media page. This ad was directed to me probably
          because I was looking for Software Engineering Jobs online, and it
          happend that ALX was offering applications for young African Leaders
          so I seized the chance and clicked on the ad.<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          I read their mission to change Africa by bringing up the next
          Generation Leaders. On a mission to capture one of the 21st century's
          greatest opportunities.

            Never doubt that a group, a small group of thoughtfull leaders,can
            change Africa; Indeed it's the only thing that ever will.

            So I took the step of faith and applied for the Software Engineering Program. During the first few days before I started the program, ALX was providing with learning materials, links to usefull recourses i.e <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">-freeCodeCamp-</a> and content to give me the headstart and mindset to Bulldoze through the Application. This was quite usefull and thoughtfull of ALX motivating and lighting the spark.</p>
        <p>
            A few days later I was accepted to start the Program, now at level One. The key in Level 1 was putting in the time and effort to go out and find the right answers. This builds the Googling skills one needs as a Software Developer. I’ll need more of that to succeed going forward. <br>
            I passed Level one eager to find out what was in store for me on level two. In turn i got a nice looking Selection Part 1 Certificate outlining my missions statement and values.

        <p>
            Currently I am at level 2 and really excited because I get to get my hands dirty by configuring the server given by installing a webserver,terminal editors E.T.C. The main project was Developing a website and hosting it on the provided server, Yet to find out how this will turn out! Hate to cut off from here but hey, I will live you with a food for thought. . .
